# Using Ecosystem Information in the Stock Assessment and Advice Process

## US Policy defines EBFM as:

>A systematic approach to fisheries management in a geographically specified area that contributes to the resilience and sustainability of the ecosystem; recognizes the physical, biological, economic, and social interactions among the affected fishery-related components of the ecosystem, including humans; and seeks to optimize benefits among a diverse set of societal goals. ([NOAA Fisheries EBFM Policy](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/ecosystem-based-fisheries-management-policy))

To use ecosystem information in assessment and management processes, *a systematic approach* is required. Examples of systematic approaches to use ecosystem information in current stock assessments, in ABC determination, and in building new multispecies and system level decision processes are presented here. While examples of SSC and Council processes come mainly from the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council (MAFMC), these examples are not exhaustive, and many more examples exist from throughout the US.

## Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs): a systematic approach for stock assessments

Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs) were pioneered in Alaska [@shotwell_synthesizing_2022], although similar approaches have been implemented in multiple regions [@tolimieri_oceanographic_2018; @haltuch_oceanographic_2020]. In general, the approach begins with a problem statement based on previously observed assessment issues combined with a stock life history conceptual model highlighting key ecosystem interactions with each life stage based on scientific literature, stakeholder knowledge, or both. Then, ecosystem indicators associated with the key interactions are developed and and analyzed. Finally, the stock specific ecosystem information is summarized and reported within the same management review process as the stock assessment itself. 

A systematic approach to using ecosystem information in stock assessments may result in direct quantitative incorporation of new data within stock assessments [@miller_state-space_2016], and or may result in a more qualitative assessment of ecosystem risk factors presented along with the assessment [@dorn_risk_2020]. Both uses allow managers to take relevant ecosystem information into account when making decisions about stock management. For example, the MAFMC SSC ABC determination process currently uses multiple information sources. 

## MAFMC SSC advice process: a systematic approach for ABC determination

Both stock and ecosystem level information can be used to inform scientific advice delivered by SSCs to Councils. For example, the MAFMC SSC has developed a systematic approach to determining scientific uncertainty to determine ABC under the Council's p-star risk policy (Fig. \ref{fig:MAFMCriskpolicy}). Considering ecosystem factors is one element of this process, which also considers Data quality, Model appropriateness, Retrospective analysis, Comparison with simpler analysis, Recruitment trends, Prediction error, Informative F, and Simulations/MSE ([MAFMC SSC 2020](https://www.mafmc.org/s/Final_Revised-OFL-CV-guidance-document_06_19_20.pdf)).

The MAFMC SSC Ecosystem Working Group was established in May 2021 to assist the Council in increasing the range of opportunities for relevant ecosystem information to be considered in management decision processes. This systematic approach to using ecosystem information explicitly includes current and potential future management decision making at the stock, multispecies, fleet, community, and ecosystem levels. The group has three general objectives:

1.  Expanding and clarifying the ecosystem portion of the SSC OFL CV determination process (short term objective, (Fig. \ref{fig:OFLCV}))
2.  Developing prototype processes to provide multispecies and system level scientific advice appropriate for Council decision making, in particular where there are multispecies and multifleet tradeoffs linking directly to economic and social outcomes (long term objective)
3.  Collaborating with SSC species leads, stock assessment leads, and relevant working groups in developing the stock-specific ESP process to specify stock-specific Ecosystem ToRs that are impactful and can be integrated into assessments (moderate-term objective)

```{r OFLCV, fig.cap="SSC process for incorporating ecosystem information into OFL CV decisions.", out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OFLCVprocess.png")
```

The keynote outlined several specific analyses in progress evaluating the impact of ecosystem factors on uncertainty in the OFL CV. Analyses aim to evaluate both the benefits of making the correct OFL CV decision and the costs of an incorrect decision. Other analyses are in progress to support MAFMC's Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). 

## MAFMC EAFM: a systematic approach to address ecosystem interactions

The MAFMC developed its EAFM structured decision process to integrate and make better use of climate, ecosystem, social, and economic information within current operational fisheries management [@muffley_there_2021, @gaichas_framework_2016]. The EAFM process begins with risk assessment to characterize a broad range of risks to managed species and fisheries, and to identify high priority fisheries for further analysis. Next, conceptual modeling identifies interactions between ecosystem risks for a high priority fishery or issue. Conceptual modeling forms a basis for management strategy evaluation (MSE) focused on actions to achieve a set of management objectives, but also includes key risks such as climate, ecological, or socioeconomic interactions identified earlier in the EAFM process. 

Regular ecosystem reporting and maintenance of long term indicator time series is a key component of a systematic approach, as noted in multiple US regions [@zador_ecosystem_2016; @harvey_importance_2020]. As MAFMC has developed and implemented EAFM, annual ecosystem reporting has evolved to more clearly link fishery management objectives with ecosystem indicators [@depiper_operationalizing_2017]. For the 2021 and subsequent reports, the SOE outline was restructured to reinforce indicator linkages to management objectives and to improve synthesis across indicators by emphasizing multiple drivers of social-ecological change. Framed climate indicators and offshore wind development indicators in terms of risks to meeting fishery management objectives to improve management relevance. Implications sections were added after all indicators to clearly link information to management. Finally, the SOE summary section was restructured into a report-card style table linking indicator trends to ecosystem level management objectives. With continued MAFMC feedback and input, brief and plain-language State of the Ecosystem reports now include updates on both general climate conditions and linkages to managed species and their habitats. These reports are compiled using open-science principles, with indicator data and documentation freely available online [@bastille_improving_2021]. Example results from the 2022 SOE were included in the keynote talk.

The MAFMC completed an initial EAFM risk assessment in 2017 [@gaichas_implementing_2018] using a combination of SOE indicators and other published risk assessments, including the Northeast Regional Climate Vulnerability Analysis [@hare_vulnerability_2016]. The risk assessment is updated annually based on ecosystem and management indicators; an example of the 2022 risk assessment was presented during the keynote. Based on the intial risk assessment, MAFMC selected summer flounder as a high priority fishery for further EAFM analysis. MAFMC completed EAFM conceptual modeling for summer flounder in 2019 [@depiper_learning_2021], and completed MSE of summer flounder recreational fishery measures to reduce discards and improve angler welfare while meeting stock status objectives ([MAFMC Summer Flounder MSE 2022](https://www.mafmc.org/actions/summer-flounder-mse)). The MSE addressed both recreational fishery-specific stakeholder defined objectives and uncertainties. Because it was conducted within the EAFM structured decision process, it also incorporated distribution shifts, identified in both risk assessment and conceptual modeling as a key ecosystem risk. Distribution shifts did not alter the rank order of management procedures, but did diminish expected returns across all of them, providing valuable insight into potential ecosystem interactions.

## Systematic approaches for potential multispecies and ecosystem level decisions

The MAFMC SSC Ecosystem working group is just beginning to address multispecies and ecosystem level indicators and analyses to provide scientific advice to the Council. Examples of multispecies indicators included fish condition and fish productivity from both survey and assessment sources. These indicators bridge stock level and community level information as they are calculated for individual stocks but evaluated across multiple stocks. Relationships between multistock productivity and other ecosystem indicators such as zooplankton abundance have shown evidence of regime shifts [@perretti_regime_2017; @morse_distinct_2017]. The SSC ecosystem WG is considering how to make more systematic use of these signals across multiple stocks in OFL CV and other decisions.

Similarly, the MAFMC SSC Ecosystem working group has recently started analyses to evaluate thresholds for ecosystem overfishing specific to the Mid-Atlantic ecosystem based on indicators and thresholds developed using worldwide data sources [@link_global_2019]. Analysis of potential ecosystem level thresholds is another important systematic approach that can be done across US regions [@samhouri_defining_2017; @tam_comparing_2017].

Focus on developing decision processes that are able to use ecosystem information

The success of the EAFM process and continued use of ecosystem information in management hinges on scientist-management collaboration with stakeholder engagement throughout.

Ecosystem reporting, risk and vulnerablity assessment useful tools
Stock level ESPs a good example
Multispecies and system level indicators of productivity change and overexploitation
