## Review of SSC Ecosystem Working Group Objectives and Intended Outcomes

The MAFMC SSC Ecosystem Working Group (WG) was established in May 2021 to assist the Council in developing short term and long term objectives to advance the operational use of ecosystem information in management decisions. As reported in [September 2021](https://www.mafmc.org/s/b_Ecosystem-WG_Proposed-Tasks-August-2021.pdf), [March 2022](https://www.mafmc.org/s/d_March2022_SSCEcoWG.pdf), and [September 2022](https://www.mafmc.org/s/b_Sept2022_SSCEcoWG.pdf) the WG has identified three general objectives:

1.  Expanding and clarifying the ecosystem portion of the SSC OFL CV determination process (short term objective)
2.  Developing prototype processes to provide multispecies and system level scientific advice appropriate for Council decision making, in particular where there are multispecies and multifleet tradeoffs linking directly to economic and social outcomes (long term objective)
3.  Collaborating with SSC species leads, stock assessment leads, and relevant working groups in developing the stock-specific Ecosystem and Socio-economic Profiles (ESP) process to specify stock-specific Ecosystem ToRs that are impactful and can be integrated into assessments (moderate-term objective)

Objectives 1 and 3 aim to integrate appropriate ecosystem information at the stock level of management decision making, while objective 2 applies to current Council EAFM processes and potential future multispecies and system level objectives.

Intended outcomes of WG work for the Council include:

-   An OFL CV process that makes better use of ecosystem information in determining the ABC
-   Evaluation of multiple ecosystem indicators and potential development of thresholds for use in a revised EAFM risk assessment and/or other Council processes
-   Increased range of opportunities for relevant ecosystem information to be considered in management decision processes

## Progress

At the joint Council/SSC meeting in October 2022, the SSC Ecosystem Working Group provided an update on current work, and sought Council feedback on priorities for development and use of integrated ecosystem-level indicators within existing or new Council processes (see [October 2022 report to the Council](https://www.mafmc.org/s/Tab12_Joint-Council-SSC_2022-10.pdf), p.3-8 and [Presentation](https://www.mafmc.org/s/Tab-12_Joint-Council-SSC-meeting_10_22.pdf), slides 6-11).

Since October 2022, WG member Sarah Gaichas submitted a summary of the SCS7 Keynote "Using Ecosystem Information in the Stock Assessment and Advice Process" that highlights MAFMC SSC and SSC Ecosystem WG projects (see draft attached at the end of this document). The WG has met once (27 February 2023).

At the February 2023 meeting, the WG received updates on four projects related to the objectives above.

### Objective 1: OFL CV and ecosystem effects

**These projects will enhance the SSC's current OFL CV process or address stock reference points, and therefore fit within existing Council decision processes.** 

#### ABC decisions with environmentally driven recruitment

WG member Mike Wilberg's lab (U. Maryland) is collaborating with John Wiedenmann's lab (Rutgers) to simulate an environmental effect on stock recruitment and test how it impacts assessment uncertainty. Implications of choosing both the appropriate OFL CV based on an environmental effect linked to recruitment and an inappropriate OFL CV will be evaluated using an updated MSE framework. The group is conducting a mini-review on environmental drivers in the region to get an idea of trends, periodicity, autocorrelation to inform the analysis. A simulated species based on Summer flounder is the initial case study. 

A literature review of summer flounder environmental influences along with analysis of relationships between multiple SOE environmental indicators and summer flounder recruitment is in progress. In addition, hypothetical relationships between environmental drivers and summer flounder recruitment have been developed for testing within the MSE framework. The group is compiling a list of harvest control rules representing those used across the US (including the MAFMC risk policy) as well as environmentally-driven control rules to be tested within the framework. Work is planned for May, and another update can be given in June 2023.

The Ecosystem WG agreed with reducing the scope of work to focus on a summer flounder-like species, rather than extending to an additional life history type.

#### Alternative stock performance metrics considering current conditions

WG member Paul Rago and SSC member Brian Rothschild presented a method to recast stock assessment outputs taking explicit account of current (perhaps environmentally driven) realized recruitments, rather than all observed historical recruitments. 

### Objective 2: Multispecies and system level ecosystem advice

**These projects can be used to inform the existing Council EAFM process, or new Council decision processes at the multispecies or ecosystem level.**

#### Ecosystem overfishing indicators

Andy Beet (NEFSC) presented an update from the April 2022 meeting on data inputs, data analysis, methodology, and planned empirical and simulation analyses to further develop regionally specific [ecosystem overfishing (EOF) indicators](https://noaa-edab.github.io/presentations/20230227_SSCEcoWG_Beet.html) at the February 2023 meeting. These indicators were presented in the 2021 SOE, but were not updated due to data constraints in 2022. Because the data inputs are still incomplete and discussion of analyses with the SSC are planned to evaluate appropriate thresholds, the EOF indicators are not included in the 2023 SOE. 

The 2021 EOF indicators were based on commercial landings of federally managed species. However, EOF indicators are designed to be based on total catch. In 2022, catch data for Atlantic menhaden was added; because this is the highest volume fishery on the US East Coast it is important to include menhaden catch in the EOF indicators. Work continues to include commercial discards and recreational catch of all species. Comparisons among commercial landings data sources were also completed to ensure that inputs to the indicators are correct. Discrepancies between the Sea Around Us data source and NEFSC data sources were resolved by including live weight instead of meat weight for shellfish landings. 

The Ecosystem WG agreed that these changes to input data were appropriate, and suggested double checking that all state landed species (not federally permitted) were included in the input data.

Detailed methods were reviewed for each of the three EOF indicators: Ryther (total catch per unit area), Fogarty (total catch per total primary production), and Friedland (total catch per mean chlorophyll). Because the originally published thresholds for each indicator were based on global average ocean productivity and trophic level of the catch, the initial step is to recalculate the thresholds using regional estimates of productivity and catch trophic level.

A simulation analysis was proposed using the Northeast US Atlantis ecosystem model to test the robustness of the resulting regional thresholds to different levels of fishing. 

The SSC Ecosystem WG agreed with this general approach and had several suggestions for simulation scenarios. First, evaluating tradeoffs between functional groups is desirable as there are many combinations of group fishing levels that may lead to, or relieve, ecosystem overfishing. Evaluating both biomass/biodiversity objectives and economic and social objectives will be important (not all species are equally valued). Finally, the relationship between transfer efficienciy and ocean warming should be investigated. If transfer efficiency is assumed constant but climate change means it is not, how is that accounted for in the EOF indicators and simulations?


#### Index Numbers for ecosystem performance

John Walden (NEFSC) presented an update to the Index Numbers analyses following suggestions at the July 2022 meeting. 

, which evaluate sets of environmental indicators and management output indicators to determine system performance. The approach combines important management outputs linked to objectives (e.g. commercial revenue, recreational days fished, right whale abundance) and likely ecosystem drivers of change in these outputs (e.g., chlorophyll a, zooplankton, aggregate fish biomass) into an analysis evaluating aggregating inputs and outputs into single indicators used to determine whether system performance has improved over time relative to a reference year. 

WG members Geret DePiper and Sarah Gaichas plan to meet with other SOE leads to explore how to bring Index Numbers forward in the upcoming SOE cycle.

### Objective 3:

**Development of Ecosystem-Socioeconomic Profiles in Research Track assessment working groups facilitates the inclusion of ecosystem information within the current stock assessment process, and therefore fits within existing Council decision processes.** 

Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs) are used within the North Pacific stock assessment process as a structured way to include stock-relevant ecosystem information within stock assessments. An overview of the North Pacific ESP development process is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYi1SAI-Xtk). An example conceptual model of ecosystem interactions with Eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod demonstrates pathways for ecosystem indicators to enter the assessment process (Fig. \ref{fig:pcodesp}, source: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/2021-alaska-fisheries-science-center-year-review#ecosystem-and-socio-economic-profiles).

```

ESPs are currently in development in the Northeast US for multiple Mid-Atlantic and New England stocks. Work under Objective 3 continues with the participation of several working group members in multiple Research Track assessment working groups:

-   Gavin Fay, black sea bass WG (ongoing)
-   Sarah Gaichas, bluefish WG (complete)
-   Paul Rago, *Illex* WG (complete)

The Bluefish Research Track ESP was presented December 7 2022, and was well received by CIE reviewers. Reviewers commented that it was the most complete treatment of a stock assessment "ecosystem ToR" they had seen, and formed a good basis for integrating further ecosystem information into the stock assessment in the future. The full ESP document is available as a working paper from the [stock assessment data portal](https://apps-nefsc.fisheries.noaa.gov/saw/sasi_files.php?year=2022&species_id=32&stock_id=6&review_type_id=5&info_type_id=5&map_type_id=&filename=WP%2001%20Tyrell%20etAl%202022%20-%20ESP.pdf).
