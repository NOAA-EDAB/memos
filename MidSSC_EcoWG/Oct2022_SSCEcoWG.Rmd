At the joint Council/SSC meeting in October 2022, the SSC Ecosystem Working Group will provide an update on current work, and seeks Council feedback on priorities for development and use of integrated ecosystem-level indicators within existing or new Council processes.

## Review of SSC Ecosystem Working Group Objectives and Intended Outcomes

The MAFMC SSC Ecosystem Working Group (WG) was established in May 2021 to assist the Council in developing short term and long term objectives to advance the operational use of ecosystem information in management decisions. As reported in [September 2021](https://www.mafmc.org/s/b_Ecosystem-WG_Proposed-Tasks-August-2021.pdf), and in [March 2022](https://www.mafmc.org/s/d_March2022_SSCEcoWG.pdf) the WG has identified three general objectives:

1.  Expanding and clarifying the ecosystem portion of the SSC OFL CV determination process (short term objective)
2.  Developing prototype processes to provide multispecies and system level scientific advice appropriate for Council decision making, in particular where there are multispecies and multifleet tradeoffs linking directly to economic and social outcomes (long term objective)
3.  Collaborating with SSC species leads, stock assessment leads, and relevant working groups in developing the stock-specific Ecosystem and Socio-economic Profiles (ESP) process to specify stock-specific Ecosystem ToRs that are impactful and can be integrated into assessments (moderate-term objective)

Objectives 1 and 3 aim to integrate appropriate ecosystem information at the stock level of management decision making, while objective 2 applies to current Council EAFM processes and potential future multispecies and system level objectives.

Intended outcomes of WG work for the Council include:

-   An OFL CV process that makes better use of ecosystem information in determining the ABC
-   Evaluation of multiple ecosystem indicators and potential development of thresholds for use in a revised EAFM risk assessment and/or other Council processes
-   Increased range of opportunities for relevant ecosystem information to be considered in management decision processes

## Progress

Since March 2022 the WG has met twice (28 April, 18 July) and is scheduled to meet 30 September 2022.

In April, the WG outlined simulation work addressing Objective 1 and reviewed current ecosystem overfishing indicators addressing Objective 2. In July, the WG reviewed a method addressing Objective 2 presented by John Walden (NEFSC). See details by Objective below. The WG also prioritized the request list for current and proposed ecosystem indicators to be worked on by the State of the Ecosystem (SOE) production team. This prioritization was used, along with priorities identified by selected MAFMC members, to outline work for the 2023 SOE reports at the August 2022 planning meeting.

In addition, WG member Sarah Gaichas participated in the SCS7 meeting in August 2022 and gave an overview of Ecosystem WG objectives and progress, as well as current MAFMC EAFM efforts. The combined MAFMC approaches were represented in [Keynote #2, Using Ecosystem Information in the Stock Assessment and Advice Process](https://noaa-edab.github.io/presentations/20220815_SCS7_Keynote2_Gaichas.html#1). [SCS7 meeting materials](https://meetings.npfmc.org/Meeting/PrintableAgenda/2945?includeAttachments=True) include many case studies for integrating ecosystem information into assessments and management from around the US. 

### Objective 1: OFL CV and ecosystem effects

**This project will enhance the SSC's current OFL CV process, and therefore fits within existing Council decision processes.** 

WG member Mike Wilberg's lab (U. Maryland) is collaborating with John Wiedenmann's lab (Rutgers) to simulate an environmental effect on stock recruitment and test how it impacts assessment uncertainty. Implications of choosing both the appropriate OFL CV based on an environmental effect linked to recruitment and an inappropriate OFL CV will be evaluated using an updated MSE framework. The group is conducting a mini-review on environmental drivers in the region to get an idea of trends, periodicity, autocorrelation to inform the analysis. A simulated species based on Summer flounder is the initial case study, with extension to a simulated species based on Atlantic Mackerel proposed for future work. 

### Objective 2: Multispecies and system level ecosystem advice

**These projects can be used to inform the existing Council EAFM process, or new Council decision processes at the multispecies or ecosystem level.**

#### Ecosystem overfishing indicators

Andy Beet (NEFSC) and Sarah Gaichas presented detailed information on current [ecosystem overfishing (EOF) indicators](https://noaa-edab.github.io/presentations/20220428_SSCEcoWG_Gaichas.html#1) at the April meeting. These indicators (Figs. \ref{fig:fogarty} and \ref{fig:ryther}) were presented in the 2021 SOE.

Link and Watson (2019) give an optimal range (green shading) of the Fogarty ratio of 0.22 to 0.92 parts per thousand (PPT).

```

```{r ryther, fig.cap="Ryther index; total landings presented on a unit area basis for the MAB. Theoretical estimates (Link and Watson, 2019) imply the index should range from 0.3 - 1.1 mt per sq km annually (green shading) with a limit of 3 mt per sq km annually, above which tipping points could occur in fished ecosystems (orange shading). Expected system-wide MSYs can be in the range of 1 to 3 mt per sq km (unshaded).", code = readLines("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOAA-EDAB/ecodata/master/chunk-scripts/human_dimensions_MAB.Rmd-ryther.R")}

```

Work is in progress to improve the current indicators, including updating landings estimates to include non-federally managed species such as Atlantic menhaden, and including discard estimates for all species. The WG gave helpful suggestions on additional sources of discard information for the indicators.

**The WG seeks Council feedback on how the EOF indicators might be used. This will help design a simulation analysis that gives insight into practical management use.**

The WG suggested that maximizing social benefits may be a good way to measure outcomes. Ecosystem overfishing reference points could be used to identify states we don't want the system to go into. The goal of the threshold would be to define "safe operating space" rather than pretending we can control the ecosystem by fishing it into an optimal state to meet our needs. The thresholds should define the bounds where fishing causes poor system performance (as defined using multiple Council objectives), but also ideally identify tradeoffs across species within the safe zone of fishing. The WG suggested that an analysis should give insight into the specific advice we should offer if we are exceeding a threshold. Conversely, if the indicator is in the good range what does that mean? What are the implications for the ecosystem? 

The WG agreed that to be used in the regional operational management context, more regional analysis of EOF thresholds and detail on regional productivity is important. For example, some issues to address include how to deal with migratory species in the region vs resident species, how to identify what species can be backed off on to correct any overfishing--is it wise to reduce landings on one or two species or equally across all? Where is the biggest bang for your buck to the ecosystem and which managers should do it? The WG recognized that this is more complex than MAFMC management, and begins discussion of how to move forward more broadly with other management partners. 

#### Index Numbers for ecosystem performance

John Walden (NEFSC) presented an overview of [Index numbers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GUbsGuVEHfavrddt6yXc8-Y6iS4qa0GM) at the July meeting, which evaluate sets of environmental indicators and management output indicators to determine system performance. The approach combines important management outputs linked to objectives (e.g. commercial revenue, recreational days fished, right whale abundance) and likely ecosystem drivers of change in these outputs (e.g., chlorophyll a, zooplankton, aggregate fish biomass) into an analysis evaluating aggregating inputs and outputs into single indicators used to determine whether system performance has improved over time relative to a reference year. 

A initial case study using the SOE indicators identified above was presented, evaluating whether system performance changed after the passage of the Sustainable Fisheries Act (SFA). Both outputs and environmental conditions improved post-SFA, but the overall performance of the ecosystem did not (Fig. \ref{fig:indexnums}; red line is combined index of system performance). 

<!--![ADD CAPTION](https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/raw/master/docs/EDAB_images/IndexNumbersExample.png)-->

```{r indexnums, fig.cap="Example index numbers approach, where Inputs include chl a, zooplankton, and aggregate fish biomass, and Outputs include commercial revenue, recreational days fished, and right whale abundance.", out.width='95%'}

knitr::include_url("https://github.com/NOAA-EDAB/presentations/raw/master/docs/EDAB_images/IndexNumbersExample.png")

```

A second case study focused on Mid-Atlantic region indicators of commercial revenue and recreational days fished as outputs, and regional zooplankton and survey aggregate fish biomass as inputs. Several other examples have been developed focusing on Mid-Atlantic indicators and objectives. 

The WG saw considerable promise in this method. It has the potential to create one or a few different system level index(es) by integrating multiple individual indicators. The point of the presentation and work so far was to demonstrate the utility of the approach and not prescribe the specific inputs and outputs used, which is best determined in dicussion with the Council.  We could Consider developing a model for commercial landings and one for recreational landings as opposed to a full ecosystem performance model. 

**The WG seeks Council feedback on how Index numbers might be used. This will help design sets of inputs and output indicators for practical management use.**

WG members Geret DePiper and Sarah Gaichas plan to meet with other SOE leads to explore how to bring Index Numbers forward in the upcoming SOE cycle.

### Objective 3:

**Development of Ecosystem-Socioeconomic Profiles in Research Track assessment working groups facilitates the inclusion of ecosystem information within the current stock assessment process, and therefore fits within existing Council decision processes.** 

Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles (ESPs) are used within the North Pacific stock assessment process as a structured way to include stock-relevant ecosystem information within stock assessments. An overview of the North Pacific ESP development process is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYi1SAI-Xtk). ESPs are currently in development in the Northeast US for multiple Mid-Atlantic and New England stocks. 

Work under Objective 3 continues with the participation of several working group members in multiple Research Track assessment working groups:

-   Gavin Fay, black sea bass WG (ongoing)
-   Sarah Gaichas, bluefish WG (ongoing)
-   Paul Rago, *Illex* WG (complete)
