\begin{letter}{New England Fishery Management Council\\50 Water Street,
Mill 2\\Newburyport, MA 01950}
\opening{To the SSC,}

In this memo we list comments and requests received on the 2019-2024
State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reports, and how we responded to those
requests. We include comments from both Councils because adjustments to
the report were made in response to both. We welcome feedback on whether
this memo is useful and how to improve it for future SOE reporting.

The attached document includes a table where we summarize all comments
and requests with sources. Since 2023, the memo is organized into
categories of requests in descending order of overall Council priority.
The Rank column summarizes priority and was derived from combined
discussion with the Mid-Atlantic SSC ecosystem working group and a
survey of selected MAFMC members coordinated by Council staff in July
2022. Ranks were reviewed and updated by MAFMC and NEFMC SSC members in
July 2024.

We specifically request feedback on the following topics to improve the
utility of the SOE for the Council:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Ecosystem level management objectives: Is the list complete? Does the
  Council have reference points, desired states, or other performance
  metrics we should address for each objective?
\item
  Current objective sections

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Profits objective and appropriate indicators: Attached analysis with
    decision points
  \item
    Stability objective: Are current indicators addressing Council
    needs?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Forecasts: What decisions or contexts would ocean forecasts be most
  useful for? What are desired characteristics of a forecast?
\end{enumerate}

We welcome comments on the entire SOE report as well as information
included in this memo, and look forward to feedback from the SSC and
Council.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\encl{State of the Ecosystem 2025: Request Tracking Memo}
