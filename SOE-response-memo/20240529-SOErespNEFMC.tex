\begin{letter}{New England Fishery Management Council\\50 Water St
No.~2\\Newburyport, MA 01950}
\opening{To the SSC,}

In this memo we list comments and requests received on the 2019-2023
State of the Ecosystem (SOE) reports, and how we responded to those
requests. We include comments from both Councils because adjustments to
the report were made in response to both. We welcome feedback on whether
this memo is useful and how to improve it for future SOE reporting.

Since 2023, the memo is organized into categories of requests in
descending order of overall Council priority. The Rank column summarizes
priority and was derived from combined discussion with the Mid-Atlantic
SSC ecosystem working group and a survey of selected MAFMC members
coordinated by Council staff in July 2022.

The attached document includes a table where we summarize all comments
and requests with sources. The Status and Progress columns briefly
summarize how we responded, with a more detailed response in each memo
section. In each detailed response, we refer to SOE sections where
changes are found or describe information that was not sufficiently
developed to include in the 2023 SOE in an effort to solicit feedback on
how best to develop indicators for future reports.

We welcome comments on the entire SOE report as well as information
included in this memo, and look forward to feedback from the SSC and
Council.

\closing{Sincerely,}
\encl{State of the Ecosystem 2024: Request Tracking Memo}
